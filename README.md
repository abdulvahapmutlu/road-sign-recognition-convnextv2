# road-sign-recognition-convnextv2
This project aims to classify road signs into 9 different categories, such as speed limit signs (20, 30, 50, etc.) and stop signs. The model used is ConvNeXt v2 Tiny, a modern deep learning model for image classification tasks, pre-trained on large datasets and fine-tuned for this specific task.
